## WDI-project-4

SHAPES is an online multiplayer game based on a well-known toy for children where a child must match blocks with a hole of the same size and shape.

SHAPES provides a new twist by making the grid dynamic, thus not only a testing a players ability to pick the correct hole but also thier reaction time and spatial awareness.
